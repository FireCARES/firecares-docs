\chapter{Acknowledgment}

The Fire$--$Community Assessment Response Evaluation System, known as FireCARES, is a `big data' analytical system providing important information to fire service and community leaders about their local fire department and the risk environment in which firefighters are called to respond. FireCARES includes more than a decade of research on structure fires and related injuries and death, as well as building footprints, housing and mobile home units, public health and census data, and vulnerable populations. FireCARES combines large sets of data from various sources to `tell the story' of a fire department in regard to its risk environment, resource capacity, and overall capability to respond to emergency
incidents.

FireCARES$--$The Community Assessment/Response Evaluation System was developed through a Partnership of Fire Service Organizations funded by DHS/FEMA Assistance to Firefighters Grants. The same team of researchers, academics, and fire service professionals who conducted the landmark NIST Residential Fireground Experiments (NIST TN 1661)~\cite{NIST:Residential} and the NIST High-Rise Fireground Experiments (NIST TN 1797)~\cite{NIST:HighRise} built FireCARES. FireCARES partners include NIST, the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), the Metropolitan Fire Chiefs Association, the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), the Commission on Fire Accreditation International (CFAI-Risk), Underwriters Laboratory Firefighter Safety Research Institute (UL FSRI), the Urban Institute, the University of Texas at Austin, and Worcester Polytechnic.

The original datasets contained in FireCARES were procured and are maintained by the team of experts that developed the system. Every fire department in the United States has a dedicated page in FireCARES. Fire Departments regularly contribute additional data to their respective pages expanding the data assets available. Although we make every effort to accurately represent information in FireCARES, source data used in determining performance scores, community assessments and safe grades may at times be inaccurate due to the quality and or quantity of underlying data sources and could adversely affect these metrics. With the continued efforts of data scientist, developers, and fire service experts,
FireCARES is becoming the premier dataset in the fire service. 

\chapter{Terms of Use}

Terms and Conditions of Use. To request to use data from the FireCARES datasets, users must agree to the terms and conditions (below), and complete the data application
form. 

The FireCARES team collects the data and maintains the FireCARES Database. Therefore, use of any information from this database must include a prominent credit line. That line is to
read as follows:

{\em FireCARES: Community Assessment/ Response Evaluation System: The content
reproduced from the FireCARES Database remains the property of FireCARES and
contributing fire departments. The FireCARES team and partners are not responsible for any
claims arising from works based on the original Data, Text, Tables, or Figures.}

{\bf Specific Terms of Agreement:}
Limited license is granted to use information from the FireCARES Database provided the Requester agrees to the following provisions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Treat the information received from FireCARES as non-public data. The data may never be used by Requester as a basis for legal actions.
\item Use the information received under the provisions of this Agreement only for not-for profit purposes including research, advocacy, education, or other fire and EMS
operations related activities supported by not-for-profit organizations.
\item All Information derived from the FireCARES Database shall remain the full property of the FireCARES Project and shall be so noted in educational material, website
presentations, and publications produced using FireCARES data.
\item Warrant that the FireCARES Team and Partner Organizations are not responsible for any claims arising from works based on the original Data, Text, Tables, or Figures.
\item Indemnify the FireCARES Team and Partner Organizations and their employees and agents from any and all liability, loss, or damage suffered as a result of claims,
demands, costs, or judgments arising out of use of FireCARES Database.
\item Requester may not sublease or permit other parities to use FireCARES data without advance written approval of FireCARES.
\end{enumerate}

The Requester's obligations hereunder shall remain in full force and effect and survive the completion of the Requester's defined project described herein. The terms of this
Agreement shall be binding upon the Requester and any organization through which his/her project is conducted. A copy of any final material produced using FireCARES data must be forwarded to the FireCARES Team.
