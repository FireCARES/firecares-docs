\chapter{Acknowledgment}

The Fire$--$Community Assessment Response Evaluation System, known as FireCARES, is a `big data' analytical system providing important information to fire service and community leaders about their local fire department and the risk environment in which firefighters are called to respond. FireCARES includes more than a decade of research on structure fires and related injuries and death, as well as building footprints, housing and mobile home units, public health and census data, and vulnerable populations. FireCARES combines large sets of data from various sources to `tell the story' of a fire department in regard to its risk environment, resource capacity, and overall capability to respond to emergency
incidents.

FireCARES$--$The Community Assessment/Response Evaluation System was developed through a Partnership of Fire Service Organizations funded by DHS/FEMA Assistance to Firefighters Grants. The same team of researchers, academics, and fire service professionals who conducted the landmark NIST Residential Fireground Experiments (NIST TN 1661)~\cite{NIST:Residential} and the NIST High-Rise Fireground Experiments (NIST TN 1797)~\cite{NIST:HighRise} built FireCARES. FireCARES partners include NIST, the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), the Metropolitan Fire Chiefs Association, the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), the Commission on Fire Accreditation International (CFAI-Risk), Underwriters Laboratory Firefighter Safety Research Institute (UL FSRI), the Urban Institute, the University of Texas at Austin, and Worcester Polytechnic.

The original datasets contained in FireCARES were procured and are maintained by the team of experts that developed the system. Every fire department in the United States has a dedicated page in FireCARES. Fire Departments regularly contribute additional data to their respective pages expanding the data assets available. Although we make every effort to accurately represent information in FireCARES, source data used in determining performance scores, community assessments and safe grades may at times be inaccurate due to the quality and or quantity of underlying data sources and could adversely affect these metrics. With the continued efforts of data scientist, developers, and fire service experts, FireCARES is becoming the premier dataset in the fire service.

\section{Risk Model}
The following data are needed at a fine spatial resolution:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Population Data
  \item Population breakdowns (by age, sex, race?, etc.)
  \item Economic Condition (e.g., household income, employment, etc).
  \item Housing Data
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Housing units by risk categories
      \item Other relevant breakdowns (e.g., single-family residence, multi-family residences, mobile homes, age, owner v. renter, vacancy rate etc.).
    \end{itemize}
  \item Health data
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Smoking prevalence
      \item For EMS Estimates, any other health survey data would be useful.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Fire Data
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Location
      \item Fire Type
      \item Property Use (to identify risk categories)
      \item Casualties
      \item Fire spread / Fire size
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
