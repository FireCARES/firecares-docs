\chapter{Introduction}

In today's fast changing economy, local government decision makers often alter fire department resources faster than fire service leaders can evaluate the potential
impact. These whirlwind decisions can leave a community without sufficient resources to respond to emergency calls safely, efficiently, and effectively. The effects of poor
decision making can have even greater impact on vulnerable populations including the elderly, young children, and people with disabilities. FireCARES -- Community Assessment, Response Evaluation System is an analytical system designed to evaluate community risk and fire department operational performance using data layers in a geographic-based system.

The FireCARES project, funded by FEMA AFG, will raise the bar for the technical discussion of community hazards and risks and the impact of changes to fire department resource levels. There will be two levels of access to FireCARES, open public access and password restricted access. The details of the information visible at the two levels of access are shown below.

\chapter{Login Permissions}

{\bf For Career or Combination Departments, login credentials will be provided to the fire chief, the local union president and/or their designees.}

{\bf For Volunteer Departments, login credentials will be provided to the fire chief or his/her designee.}

{\bf Researchers and/or National Organization Leaders may request login via the website.}

First-time users will go to \href{https://firecares.org}{FireCARES} and click on the login button. The login opening screen will require the name, email address, login username and password. Following entry of these attributes, the user will click the ``login'' icon and be sent for immediate authentication. Upon authentication, authorization will be given and the user will be logged into FireCARES.

Upon initial login, a disclaimer, permissions statement, and accompanying site orientation will begin. These items must be viewed, read, and acknowledged before the user is allowed to proceed. This portion cannot be skipped and will clearly explain the responsibility of a FireCARES user. An ``agree'' icon must be clicked before proceeding to the login template. Subsequent logins will proceed directly to the FireCARES page.

An authenticated user (Chief and/or the local union president) can provide login authority to others in their department as they deem necessary and appropriate, but must keep a record of those authorized. To provide login authority, the Chief and/or local union president will provide a list of eligible emails to FireCARES administration. Upon receipt, logins will be created for each email provided. To minimize logins being shared, a robust password must be implemented upon registration. Changing passwords on 90 day cycles is strongly encouraged but will not initially be required.


Upon entering the require credentials, a login username and password will be provided. Each login will launch a disclaimer and permissions statement. These items must be read and acknowledged before the user is allowed to proceed. This portion cannot be skipped and should clearly explain the responsibility as a FireCARES user. An ``agree'' icon must be clicked before proceeding to the login page. To minimize logins being shared, a robust password must be implemented upon
registration. Changing passwords on 90 day cycles is strongly encouraged but will not initially be required.
